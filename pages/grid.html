            <p>*Graphic and web-designers work in the dimension that can be broken down to the rectangle, be it a page or a screen. This determines the shape of the grid as well. The lines within the grid are customized. Creators can build the grid themselves or rely on ready grid systems, while designers can use the same grid system throughout the whole piece of design, or create a new grid for each page to express their ideas. <a href="//www.eleken.co/blog-posts/grid-layout-design-history-tips-and-best-examplesLinks" target="_blank">to an external site.</a> </p>

                <h2>The Cove</h2>
                <p><i>Seth Rosenbloom</i></p>

                    <p>I’m resting on a tide-bleached tree, and you
                    are looking for stones. Like we’ve always done,
                    from back when our son was little. But now,
                    it’s up to us to fill in the bucket. Stones lapped
                    smooth by the force of the moon. Pigmented
                    in colors of sibling planets. Mars-red. Jupiters
                    with ghostly rings. You’re too far away to hear,
                    and there is no pain, so I won’t make a fuss. It’s just
                    thumps in my throat. My pulse runs up numbers
                    on the screen of my watch, even as I sit here, still.
                    My mind re-walks the trail through the forest
                    to where the headlands open. Down the switchback.
                    Past fallen old growths, their upended roots spider
                    towards the sky. We’re the only ones who hiked here
                    today. Even if there were cell coverage, how many hours
                    before help arrives? So, breathe, bear down on the abdomen
                    like the cardiologist said. Listen to the wind rush
                    into this mouth of salinity. This cove, embraced by hills
                    that shoulder hemlocks. Lava born from the mantel,
                    cooled into outcrops, carved to pool star fish and purple
                    anemones. Home of endless give and take.</p>

                <h2>Conversation Piece</h2>
                <p><i>by Rae Armantrout</i></p>

                <p>There is much to be said
                on the way vine leaves

                accede

                to the wishes
                of the wind,

                all aflutter,
                then rebound

                as if nothing</p>

                <h2>Say Less</h2>
                <p><i>by Esther Kondo Heller</i></p>

                <p>If erasure is a reconsideration of a text or an image, then who do I reconsider in the archive? The bus is an archive of bodies, it contains a newspaper that has been left for us to complete the crossword. A train holds prints exposed and unexposed, I walk into the A train one afternoon and watch a woman crack a hard boiled egg open on the rail. She peels the shell, pulls a small salt shaker out of her bag, and salts the egg to her liking… she eats it and gets off at the next stop. I am no longer on the train but I think about the sound of the tapping egg again. I go to the archive to reconsider, to meddle, to not mind my own business because I mind, I do not alter.</p></article>
